h1 "Sheeesh, okay."
h1 "What about 5 cm/s?"

you "Well that's pretty nice, but still, two literal idiots in love. Can't handle watching that for the second time."

h1 "Ditto, by the way-"
h1 "*interrupted by her phone vibrating"
h1 "Oh shit, I forgot I have a group work due tomorrow. They're asking for my progress."

you "Well? Get going already."

h1 "Okay, okay, I'm going to my room."
h1 "By the way, can I take another bite?"

you "*sighs"
you "Just take the damn box, there's like, what, four pieces left?"

h1 "You sure?"

you "Yeah, I'm full anyway."

h1 "Bet. Thank youuuuuu." 
h1 "*runs off"

you "\[She got the edge pieces.\]"
    "\[Well, as long as she's happy, I don't care.\]" 
    "\[It's just a glorified pancake, nothing big.\]" 

"*time skip to praktikum 2. MC's having an all-nighter trying to speedrun TP Fisika. Sadly, his WD-40 lubed brain is having a pretty hard time"

you "\[GOTTA FINISH THE FLOWCHARTS.\]"
you "*checks his phone, his friend that had done his module the week before sends the procedure to derive an equation or something"
you "*got a step wrong"
you "FUCKING PIECE OF SHIT PHYSICS PRELIMINARY. DERIVE THIS, DERIVE THAT."
you "*sits down, trying to calm himself"
you "*chugs coffee that is more of a motor oil than coffee"
you "\[Aight. Calm down, calm down, calm DOWN, CALM THE FUCK DOWN.\]"
you "*threw his pen so hard it fucking broke"
you "\[Aight, fuck this shit.\]" 
you "*proceeds to draw the ugliest, pure undecipherable flowchart"
you "*his 6 am alarm goes off"
you "\[Great, no fucking sleep.\]"

"*time skip to the actual praktikum"

you "*arrives at the lab entrance"
you "*takes his nametag off and presents it to the air"

ag	"Uhh, hey. I'm right here."

you "*got up from his trance and walked to the scanner"
you "Oh, yeah. Sorry."
	
you "*enters the lab and goes to his desk"

h1 "*notices"
h1 "Huh?, a word?" 

you "Yeah?"
	
h1 "Are you okay? To be honest, you look like shit."

you "Never been better."

h1 "Did you have any sleep last night?"

you "If you count a bunch of two second microsleeps as sleep, then yes."

h1 "*sighs"
h1 "You know you have a lab session tomorrow, yet you still force yourself out. Was it the preliminaries?"

you "*nods"

h1 "Gosh, take care of yourself. You know you can just come over to my room if you got  any problems."
h1 "You know what? Take the day off. I'll go to the practice head and ask him to put put you in the reserve session."

you "Nah, I'm good."

h1 "Come on, there won't be any score discount if you're on sick leave."

you "No, really, I'm okay. You're such a worrywart."

h1 "Fine. But tell me if you feel sick or anything, okay?" 

you "O-Okay"

h1 "Good."

"*Suddenly, he faints on his way to the desk"

"*After some time, he wakes up in the infirmary"

you "*slowly opens his eyes"
you "Where am I?"
you "\[Whatever this place is, it sure has some top notch pillow.\]"

h1 "Hey, are you awake?"

you "*his eyes shot open"
"*he's in his senpai's lap, her hands stroking his head
*they stare at each other"
you "Uhh, yeah?"

h1 "You big dummy, why didn't you tell me you're sick?"
h1 "Do you know how worried I was?"

you "*just nods his head, still can't believe he's in her lap while getting caressed"

h1 "I mean, let's forget about you for once. Do you have any idea how dangerous it is to work half-awake IN A LABORATORY?"
h1 "Do you even realize that you are a safety hazard at that moment?"

you  "*nods and blushes"

h1 "I mean, gosh, if you don't feel well, just say it. I don't want you to get hurt."

you "*silent"

h1 "Hey, are you even listening?"

you "Yes. (clearly not listening)"

h1 "*realizes that she's still stroking his hair while scolding him"
h1 "*blushes too and stops stroking"

you "Hey, why did you-"

h1 "*stands up, MC fell on his head"

you "Ow."

h1 "J-Just take the day off and take care of yourself!"

you "*sat back up"
you "Hey, wait!"

h1 "Just go back home! I'll take care of the reserve session. (runs, leaving the MC)"

you "*stands up, dumbfounded"
you "Damn. That felt good."

"*time skip to the next day"

you "*sits inside his room, he's free on Fridays"
you "*reminiscing the lap pillow and headpats"
you "\[GAHD DAMN.\]"
you "\[I NEED IT MORE.\]"
you "\[I FUCKING NEED MORE LAP PILLOWS.\]"
you "*slaps himself"
you "Control yourself, Me."
you "*decides to take a shower"
you "*gets dressed and gets out of his room"
you "*opens his door"
you "*FL1 stands right in front of it"

you "Oh shit."

h1 "G-Good morning."

you "Uhh, good morning?"

h1 "How have you been? Are you okay?"
		
you "Oh, I'm okay."

h1 "Are you sure, though?"

you "No, really. I'm fine now. I just woke up early."

h1 "Thank God you're okay."
h1 "By the way, I'm really sorry for, well-"

you "Nah, it's fine. I mean, It's not like I can see you blush that red everyday ."

you "\[I'm free today.\]"
you "\[No homework or the ilk either.\]"
you "\[Might as well.\]"
you "Hey,  are you free this afternoon?"

h1 "What?"

you "I got a promo for two free movie tickets. I mean, if you're free, we can go to the cinema."

h1 "Are you serious?"

you "Of course I am."

h1 "L-Let me check my schedule first."
	
h1 "Well I don't have anything of importance to do past 4 am. Is it too late?"

you "No, no, it's perfect. So, see you at 4 or 5?"

h1 "O-Okay."

"*time skip to the afternoon"

you "*got out of his room at 4 and finds FL1 already waiting at the dorm's lounge"

h1 "So, shall we?"

you "Yeah, let's go."

#*they walked to an alternate version of Jatos
#you *looking at the movie schedule

you "You got anything in mind?"

h1 "I thought you already had the tickets."

you "I have a promo for two free tickets, we can still choose the movie."

h1 "Ah, I see."
h1 "Miracle in Cell No. 7 it is, then."

you "Alright."
you "Two tickets for Miracle in Cell No. 7, please."

"*time skip"

you "I *sniffle* I can't believe the world is so unfair."

h1 "*literally crying a river"
h1 "I know right.."
 
you "Uhhmmm."
you "Oh yeah, I forgot I have an assignment due tomorrow, but whatever."

h1 "You should know better not to procrastinate, lest you faint again."

you "But I'm going on a date with my cute lab assistant. I can't let the occasion go, can I?"
you "*blushes, realizes what he just said"

h1 "*blushes too"

"*awkward silence"

you "Do you wanna get a meal?"

h1 "Y-Yes, please!"

"*time skip, they arrive at their dorm"
		
h1 "Hey btw. Thank you so, so much for the, uuuhmmm, outing."

you "Don't mention it. We need to have some fun once in a while, don't we?"

h1 "But really, you paid for the whole thing, I don't-"

you "Shush, just consider it as a pay back for yesterday. Though, I think I have something to ask you."

h1 "What is it?"

you "Reduce the moe gap. I don't think I can hold my laughter if I see you in your asprak mode next session."

h1 "*giggles"
h1 "*leans in to MC and hugs him"
h1 "Thank you."

you "\[She hugs me. SHE IS HUGGING ME.\]"

h1 "So, uhhh."
h1 "Bye, have a good night!"

"*time skip, a couple days later, at lunch time"

you "*has got his food and is looking for a seat"
you "*sees the spot in front of FL1 is empty"

h1 "*sees him and waves"

you "*scoots there"
you "Fancy seeing you here."

h1 "Yeah, yeah, we've been sitting together at lunch for like, what, two weeks? Just get your ass here if you need a seat."

you "Damn, no need to be so blunt."

h1 "Yeah, whatever."

you "By the way, you got class after lunch?"

h1 "Yes, and then a group assignment. You?"

you "Online class, the lecturer's sick, so I'm going to-"

friend2	 "Hey, girl. How've you been?"

h1 "*caught off guard"
h1 "Oh, hey there, I'm go-"

friend2	"Oh look who we have here?"
friend2 "Did you get yourself a boyfriend?"

you "*his brain short circuited"
you "\[Boyfriend?\]"
you "\[Am I in a relationship with her?\]"
you "\[Well, of course I am, but is it that kind of relationship?\]"
you "\[How the fuck am I supposed to answer them?\]"

h1 "Come on, give him some slack."

you "*moves aside"

h1 "We're just having lunch. Y'all don't get some?"

friend2 "Oh, we had one already. By the way, did you hear that â€¦."

you "\[Hol up. She doesn't deny it, though.\]"
you "\[Could she?\]"
you "\[Nah, I'm thinking too far off.\]"
you "\[Or maybe?\]"

friend2	"Oh shit, pop quiz, gotta go. See you later!"

h1 "See ya, take care."

"*FL1 and MC continue to eat in silence"

you "Uhh, senpai?"

h1 "Yeah?"

you "Did I hear it wrong or did you not answer your friends' question?"
you "I mean, I know they're just joking and all, but-"

h1 "Shut. Just eat your damn meal."

you "\[T-This can't be.\]"
you "\[God, I love her.\]"

"*time skip to Thursday"

"*MC just finished Praktikum 2 Pengkom"
"*he couldn't understand a thing"
"\[What was that.\]"
"\[I'mma go touch some grass.\]"
"*he prepares for a walk, but then he remembered something"
"\[You know what will make this stroll better?\]"
"*whips out his phone"
"*calls FL1"

h1 "Moshi-moshi."

you "Hey, how's it going? You good?"

h1 "Yes. Need something?"

you "No, just wondering if you're free today?"

h1 "My brother in harmonia progressio, I'm literally watching SpongeBob at the living room."

you "*opens his door and heads to the lounge"
you "*sees FL1 laying on the sofa while munching down an ice cream sandwich"
you "So, you're free?"

h1 "You're up to something?"

you "I'm going outside, preferably touching some grass while at it. Wanna come?"

h1 "Sure, wait a sec."

#"*they walk outside"

h1 "So, you know where we're going?"

you "Good question, I have no idea."

h1 "I have somewhere in mind."

you "Wher-"
		
h1 "Just wait and see."

# MIXUE

h1 "Ta da."

you "Ice cream?"

h1 "Not just ice cream though, there's smoothie and shit, too. Come on in, my treat."

you "But I'm the one th-"
		
h1 "*looking at the menu"
h1 "So, what do you want?"

you "Uhh, I want something simple. Prolly a vanilla soft serve and a boba."

h1 "You know they can mix both of them together, right?"

you "Sometimes, mixing similar food is not the best course of action. And I'm in the mood to savor each of them separately. "

h1 "Damn, okay Anton Ego."
		*heads to the cashier
		"Hi, I'd like to order two vanilla soft serves and two brown sugar boba."

you "\[She's in a really high spirit today.\]"

h1 "Alright, we just have to wait for our ice cream now."

you "Uh huh."

*silence

h1 "So, how's college?"

you "So far? Not ideal, still got some skill issues with physics and chemistry. But
		calculus' not as hard as I thought, though."

h1 "Remember, if you have any trouble, just hit me up."

you "Yeah, yeah, I still remember your scolding when I was-"

h1 "Do. Not. Continue." *blushes

you "By the way, how's Garden of Sinners."

h1 "Found pdf's of some of the series. Pretty damn good, I must say."

you "I know you'd like it."
		*sips on his water bottle

*silence

h1 "So."
		"Got any girls on your sights, yet?"

you *spits/choked on his water
		"Wh-What?"

h1 *shit eating grin
		"You heard me, big guy."

you "What kind of question is that?"

h1 "Oh come on, just answer it."

you *blushes
		"\[Fuck.\]"
		"W-Well, there's this one girl."

h1 "Hmmm?"

you "Uhhh."

Server		: "Order number 66."

h1 "Hey, that's ours."
		*takes the order
		"Here are yours."

you "Ah, thanks."

h1 "Wanna go to the park?"

you "S-Sure."

*they left the store, time skip to park. They got a seat there

h1 "You know what? They do taste good when separated."

you "Right?"

h1 "By the way, regarding my question earlier."

you *sweating bullets

h1 "I also have a guy in sight."

you "\[Could it be me?\]"

h1 "Truth to be told, I don't really care about getting into a, you know, relationship.
		But then, there was this lazy, sorry excuse of a physics student."

you "\[She's talking about me.\]"

h1 "This guy was, ugghhh. You know, I sometimes wonder how he got into ITB."
		"He's pretty cute, not gonna lie. And he also as a tendency to force himself to do
		something he knows he can't."

you "Sounds like someone I know."

h1 *smiles
		"But due to circumstances, we got closer."
		"And closer."
		"And closer."
		"And the fact he, too, is a weeb doesn't help."
		"But, I think the weeb part seals the deal."
		"Then we went on a date together."
		"Had some pretty deep talk."
		"And I think I fell for him."

you "Oh, he's a weeb?"

h1 "A big one, that is."

you "He doesn't happen to like an old anime, does he?"

h1 "If you count a 2004 anime that is now pretty obscure as old, then he does."

you "Huh. I guess he suits you so much."

h1 "That he does, (MC). That he does."

you "Is there anything you like more about him?"

h1 "Well, just normal stuff, I guess. It sure feels nice to have someone you can rely to,
		and be someone he can rely on, too."

you "\[Yep, that's 100% me.\]"
"Tell me."
		"Do you love him?"

h1 "Wanna know the answer?"

you *nods

h1 "Here's my answer, (MC), and I hope you do, too."
*leans in and kisses him

*time skip, they're in a relationship

		"\[Where the fuck is my phone.\]"
		*fumbles around
		"\[There it is.\]"

		*looks around, the lounge looks like a damn landfill from all the wrappings and snack
		packagings
                          "\[Better clean them up ASAP before I got scolded.\]"
                          *tried to stand up, but can't
                          *realized his right arm fell asleep
